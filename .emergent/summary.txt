The AI engineer's work has progressed through several critical phases. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing core application functions, resolving dashboard login issues by enhancing backend authentication with robust password hashing, SSL support, and a comprehensive emergency fallback. This also included fixing frontend submission and SPA routing, and addressing a blank page deployment issue on Render by correctly configuring 's  and 's SPA fallback. Subsequently, a major overhaul of the article system was initiated, transitioning to SEO-friendly slugs and integrating Alembic for database migrations. This was crucial for Google News optimization and fixing article not found errors. Concurrently, the engineer addressed social media sharing problems (Facebook debugger Bad Response Code) by refining crawler detection and ensuring 200 OK responses with correct meta tags, and fixed article deletion functionality. The contact form, which was experiencing blank pages and database insertion failures, was then robustified with comprehensive frontend UI protection, a backend emergency fallback system for message storage, and simplified Pydantic validation to resolve 422 errors. Most recently, a dedicated Messages section was successfully integrated into the dashboard to display contact submissions. The current task involves a major frontend redesign, specifically re-ordering articles on the homepage and implementing a flexible category labeling system for articles.

The Crewkerne Gazette aims to be a modern, populist news website with a dynamic homepage, distinct sections (News, Music, Documentaries, Comedy), and a secure admin CMS. The CMS supports rich-text article creation, featured image uploads via Cloudinary, embeds, categories, publisher, subheading, and a breaking news flag. It also manages contact messages and site-wide settings like admin passwords and a breaking news banner. The design prioritizes a dark, sleek aesthetic with bold colors, strong typography, responsiveness, and high visual appeal.

Key explicit requirements and resolved issues include:
1.  **Robust Authentication**: Stable admin dashboard login with admin/admin123, secure password hashing, SSL connections, and a production-ready emergency fallback system.
2.  **Deployment Stability**: Resolved blank page issues on Render by correctly configuring frontend asset paths and backend SPA routing.
3.  **Article Management & SEO**: Transitioned to SEO-friendly slugs for articles, fixed article not found errors, implemented dynamic sitemaps (, ), , and enhanced JSON-LD structured data ( schema).
4.  **Social Sharing Optimization**: Ensured correct titles, images (Cloudinary URLs), and descriptions appear when articles are shared, addressing Facebook debugger Bad Response Code issues.
5.  **Database Migration**: Migrated from in-memory storage to persistent PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy and Alembic for schema changes.
6.  **Contact Form Functionality**: Fixed issues where messages weren't submitting, saving to the database, or appearing in the dashboard. Implemented a dedicated Messages section in the admin dashboard for viewing contacts.
7.  **Upcoming**: Major frontend redesign to prioritize news articles on the homepage and implement a flexible, multi-selectable category label system for articles.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer initiated a major frontend redesign and article category system implementation.

The current work focuses on:
1.  **Updating the Backend Database Model**:
    *   The  model in  was modified to include a new field: . This allows articles to be associated with multiple predefined categories.
2.  **Updating Backend Pydantic Model**:
    *   The  Pydantic model in  was updated to include , ensuring that  can be received and returned via the API.
3.  **Defining Available Categories**:
    *   A list of  (e.g., 'Satire', 'Straight Talking', 'Opinion', 'Sports', 'Gossip', 'Politics', 'Local News', 'News', 'Agony Aunt', 'Special', 'Exclusive') was defined in .
4.  **Updating Article Creation Endpoint**:
    *   The  endpoint in  was modified to:
        *   Properly handle multiple tags separated by commas.
        *   Process and save the new  field for created articles, ensuring only valid categories from  are stored.
5.  **Updating Article Model Conversions**:
    *   The process of converting  objects to  Pydantic models (and vice-versa) was updated across various backend functions to correctly include the  field.

The AI engineer is currently in the process of ensuring all  model conversions throughout the backend correctly handle and include the newly added  field. This ensures data consistency before proceeding with frontend UI implementation.
