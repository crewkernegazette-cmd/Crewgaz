<analysis>**original_problem_statement**:
The user wants to add a new feature called Trending Opinions to the website.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **Dashboard Integration**: Create a new section in the admin dashboard titled Trending Opinions. This section should allow an authenticated user to upload an image.
2.  **Website Display (Homepage)**: The most recently uploaded Trending Opinions images should be displayed on the homepage in a new section below the existing articles section.
3.  **Dedicated Archive Page**: Create a new page on the website that catalogues all uploaded Trending Opinions images. The images on this page must be organized and displayed based on the date they were uploaded (e.g., grouped by Month and Day).
4.  **Navigation**: The existing Play Dover Dash section/button on the homepage should be removed and replaced with a new button styled with slapstick Internet humor that links to the new Trending Opinions archive page.
5.  **Backend Support**:
    *   Create a new database table (e.g., ) to store the image URLs and timestamps.
    *   Implement a secure API endpoint for uploading images (which will be stored on Cloudinary) and saving the record to the database.
    *   Implement API endpoints to fetch the latest opinions for the homepage and all opinions for the archive page.

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack application with a React frontend and a FastAPI/PostgreSQL backend. The architecture has been consolidated so that the FastAPI backend serves both the API (under ) and the static React build files, eliminating previous cross-domain issues. The application features article management, user authentication, a contact form, and a recently added browser game called Dover Dash. The agent was in the process of debugging the game when the user requested the new Trending Opinions feature.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working on**: Starting the implementation of the Trending Opinions feature. The agent viewed the  file with the intention of adding a new SQLAlchemy model for the Trending Opinions. This was the first step in addressing the new feature request from the user.
*   **Status**: NOT STARTED
*   **Agent Testing Done**: N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?**: both
*   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1**: Dover Dash score submission fails from the game UI. (Priority: P0)
*   **Issue 2**: Dover Dash game has several unverified fixes from the last user report. (Priority: P1)

**Issues Detail**:
*   **Issue 1: Dover Dash score submission fails**
    *   **Attempted fixes**: The agent identified that the game, served from , was being blocked by backend CORS policy. A fix was implemented by adding  to the  list in . The backend API was tested directly and worked, but a full end-to-end test from the game UI was never performed to confirm the fix. The user's last report before the new feature request was that scores were still not saving.
    *   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Play the game in the local environment until the Game Over screen.
        2.  Open the browser's developer console (Network and Console tabs).
        3.  Enter a player name and click SUBMIT SCORE.
        4.  Observe the network request to . Check for CORS errors, 4xx/5xx status codes, or incorrect request payloads in the developer console.
        5.  Check the  output from the debugging statements added in .
        6.  Verify the backend logs for any errors during the request.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a core feature of the game and is currently broken, preventing user progression and competition. Fixing it will complete the Dover Dash functionality.
    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
    *   **Blocked on other issue**: None

*   **Issue 2: Dover Dash unverified gameplay fixes**
    *   **Attempted fixes**: In the last iteration, the agent implemented fixes for: level progression not matching wave number, boats spawning outside the play area, lack of boat variety, and added quirky end-of-wave comments.
    *   **Next debug checklist**: These fixes have not been verified by the user. A quick playthrough is needed to confirm they are all working as intended.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To ensure the game is polished and meets all the user's previous requirements before moving on completely.
    *   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING

**Completed work in this session**
*   **Single-Domain Architecture**: Refactored the application so the FastAPI backend serves the React frontend, resolving numerous cross-domain and social sharing issues.
*   **Dover Dash Game**: Implemented a complete, playable browser game () with an 8-bit satirical style, backend leaderboard, and multiple iterative bug fixes and feature enhancements based on user feedback.
*   **Social Follow Bar**: Added a sleek, responsive social media follow bar () to the header of the site.
*   **Homepage YouTube Video**: Embedded and styled a YouTube video in the News section of the homepage.
*   **Deployment Error Fix**: Resolved a Render deployment failure by adding the missing  dependency to  and then subsequently removing it after switching the game's leaderboard to use PostgreSQL.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
The main outstanding issue is the recurring failure of the Dover Dash score submission, as detailed in the **All Pending/In progress Issue list**.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: The initial summary noted persistent database connection issues in the test environment.
*   **Recurrence count**: N/A in this session, but the primary recurring issue has been the **Dover Dash leaderboard functionality**, which has failed multiple times across different fix attempts.
*   **Status**: IN PROGRESS

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (CRA), FastAPI, PostgreSQL.
*   **Single-Domain Deployment**: FastAPI serves the static React build, unifying the frontend and backend under one domain.
*   **Data Management**: SQLAlchemy ORM, Pydantic, Alembic migrations.
*   **Game Development**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript game loop, event handling, and collision detection.
*   **Cloud Services**: Cloudinary (images), Render (deployment).

**key DB schema**
*   **articles**: 
*   **users**: 
*   **dover_dash_leaderboard**: 
*   **(Upcoming) trending_opinions**: 

**changes in tech stack**
No permanent changes. The agent briefly introduced  but correctly reverted to the existing PostgreSQL stack.

**All files of reference**
*   : Heavily modified to serve the frontend, add social sharing workarounds, and implement the Dover Dash API. Will be modified for Trending Opinions.
*   : Modified to add the  table. Will be modified for Trending Opinions.
*   : A new, large, self-contained HTML file for the game, which has undergone numerous revisions.
*   : Modified to use a relative  to support the single-domain architecture.
*   : Modified to add and then replace the Dover Dash button.
*   : Modified to add an embedded YouTube video.
*   : New file created for the social media follow links.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   : This is a monolithic file with over 1500 lines of embedded JavaScript and CSS. While created per user's request, it is difficult to maintain. A future refactor could separate JS logic into modules and CSS into a dedicated stylesheet.

**key api endpoints**
*   : Retrieves Dover Dash high scores.
*   : Submits a new score for Dover Dash.
*   : Serves the HTML file for the game.
*   All other API routes are prefixed with . The root  and other non-API paths serve the React application.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   **Single-Domain Architecture**: The application now runs on a single domain. The FastAPI backend serves the static React build files. All API calls from the frontend should use relative paths to . This was a major architectural change to solve social media sharing issues.
*   **Dover Dash Score Bug**: The most critical unresolved bug is the failure of score submission for the Dover Dash game. The last attempted fix (CORS policy change) was not verified from the frontend. **You must verify this fix before starting the new Trending Opinions feature.**
*   **Database Credentials**: The user provided PostgreSQL credentials in the chat history. Use these for any database-related tasks.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
*    (updated multiple times by testing agents)

*   **Cloudinary**: Used for image storage for articles. Will be used for Trending Opinions.
*   **PostgreSQL**: Main application database, hosted on Render.
*   **Google Fonts**: Used for the Press Start 2P font in the Dover Dash game.

**Testing status**
*   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES (for backend changes)
*   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
*   **Test files created**: None
*   **Known regressions**: The Dover Dash score submission has repeatedly failed after attempted fixes.

**Credentials to test flow:**
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL 17
*   **Host**: 
*   **Port**: 
*   **Database Name**: 
*   **User**: 
*   **Password**:  (Note: This was provided by user, likely placeholder name)
*   **DATABASE_URL**: (Likely derived from the above, managed by Render environment)

**What agent forgot to execute**
*   The agent did not perform an end-to-end verification of the CORS fix for the Dover Dash score submission. It tested the backend API in isolation but did not test the submission from the game's UI, which is where the user reported the failure. This bug remains unconfirmed as fixed.</analysis>
