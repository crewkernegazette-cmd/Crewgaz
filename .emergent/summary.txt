The trajectory details the AI engineer's comprehensive journey from stabilizing The Crewkerne Gazette application to implementing major features and resolving critical deployment issues. Initially, the focus was on fixing dashboard login failures, database connection mismatches, and frontend API URL misconfigurations, culminating in an emergency bypass system. The AI then addressed user-reported social sharing metadata issues and missing dashboard CRUD functionality for articles. This involved implementing server-side meta-tag generation for crawlers and full edit/delete features. A significant phase was dedicated to troubleshooting Render deployment errors related to , React version conflicts, missing  and  dependencies. Following these, the application was successfully migrated from in-memory storage to a persistent PostgreSQL database, and Cloudinary was integrated for robust image uploads. The final major fix involved overhauling the authentication system for the staff portal, implementing a database-first approach with forced admin password resets, SSL support, and comprehensive logging for production stability. The current state is a stable, feature-rich application ready for further SEO enhancements.

The Crewkerne Gazette aims to be a modern, edgy news website with a populist brand, featuring a dynamic homepage, dedicated sections (News, Music, Documentaries, Comedy), and a secure admin CMS. The CMS must support article creation/management (rich text, featured image upload, embeds, categories, publisher, subheading, breaking news flag), contact message management, and site-wide settings (admin password, maintenance mode, breaking news banner). The design emphasizes a dark, sleek background with bold contrasting colors, strong typography, responsiveness, and high visual appeal. Critical functionalities also include robust social media integration with professional sharing metadata (Open Graph, Twitter Cards) and Google News optimization.
Initial work focused on resolving critical issues such as admin dashboard login failures, database configuration inconsistencies, and ensuring correct frontend-backend communication.
Subsequent explicit requirements expanded to:
1.  **Social Sharing Fix**: Article links should display correct titles, images, and descriptions when shared on social media.
2.  **Dashboard Article Management**: Add crucial edit and delete functionality for articles within the admin dashboard.
3.  **Backend Refinements**: Address duplicate routes, add input sanitization, and remove unused static file serving logic.
4.  **Database Persistence**: Migrate from the in-memory/emergency database to a persistent PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.
5.  **Cloud Image Hosting**: Integrate Cloudinary for image uploads, replacing base64, to ensure reliable image display in social previews.
6.  **Robust Authentication**: Ensure stable and persistent user login for the admin dashboard by properly seeding users in the PostgreSQL database.
7.  **Google News/SEO Enhancements**: Implement dynamic sitemaps (, ), update JSON-LD structured data to  schema, and add a  file.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully fixed a persistent login issue in the staff portal dashboard. This involved a comprehensive enhancement of the backend's authentication system to ensure robustness and reliability in a production environment with a PostgreSQL database.

The following specific changes were implemented:
1.  **SSL Support for Database Connections**: Modified the SQLAlchemy engine creation in  to automatically include  in the PostgreSQL connection string if not already present, ensuring secure connections in production.
2.  **Robust Password Hashing**: Integrated the  library, specifically , for more secure and compatible password hashing and verification. The  and  functions were centralized in  and subsequently used in  and . Duplicate password-related functions were removed from .
3.  **Enhanced Database Initialization and Force Password Reset**: The  function in  was improved. It now not only checks for the existence of the 'admin' and 'admin_backup' users but also verifies their passwords. If password verification fails for an existing user (e.g., due to an old hash format or corruption), it automatically resets the user's password to the default ('admin123' or 'admin_backup'), ensuring reliable access.
4.  **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging was added throughout the authentication process in both  and . This provides step-by-step information on user queries, password comparisons, and authentication outcomes, which is critical for debugging production issues.
5.  **Debug Endpoint for Production**: A new, protected API endpoint  was added to . This route, requiring JWT authentication and an admin role, returns anonymized user data (username, password test result, database connection status) to allow administrators to verify database user states in a live environment without exposing sensitive information.

This comprehensive fix ensures that the staff portal login with the default admin/admin123 credentials is stable, works reliably after deployments and restarts, and is equipped with robust debugging tools for future issues.
