The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing and enhancing the Crewkerne Gazette application, progressing from foundational deployment issues to complex feature implementation. Initial phases involved resolving critical Render deployment problems, correcting authentication flows, and addressing persistent frontend errors. A significant challenge was the convoluted database setup, initially misidentified as a MongoDB/PostgreSQL mismatch, later confirmed as a production migration issue for new schema elements.

The engineer systematically implemented core features like an article category system, a GB News-style homepage layout with pinning and priority, and a robust API subdomain architecture with cross-subdomain cookie authentication. Recurring issues included frontend-backend communication, incorrect API prefixes, environment variable inconsistencies, and critical database persistence failures, which were ultimately traced to a code duplication bug in the backend and a local testing environment's misleading database connections. The final trajectory segments are dedicated to refining article creation with image uploads via Cloudinary (a 2-step process) and ensuring SEO-friendly social media previews and reliable article linking.

The Crewkerne Gazette is a modern, populist news website aiming for a dynamic homepage with distinct content sections (News, Music, Documentaries, Comedy) and a secure admin CMS. The CMS supports rich-text article creation, featured image uploads (via Cloudinary), embeds, categories, publisher, subheading, breaking news flag, and contact message management. The design emphasizes a dark, sleek, responsive aesthetic.

Key requirements and resolved issues include:
1.  **Robust Authentication**: Stable admin login with secure password hashing and cross-subdomain cookies.
2.  **Deployment Stability**: Addressed Render crashes by configuring asset paths, routing, and error boundaries.
3.  **Article Management & SEO**: Implemented SEO-friendly slugs, dynamic sitemaps, robots.txt, and JSON-LD data.
4.  **Social Sharing Optimization**: Ensuring correct meta tags for shared articles.
5.  **Persistent Database**: Migrated to PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy and Alembic.
6.  **Contact Form Functionality**: Fully functional with dashboard message display.
7.  **Homepage Redesign & Category Labels**: Implemented news article prioritization (GB News-style top rail) and a flexible, multi-selectable category label system.
8.  **API Subdomain**: Backend API () and frontend () with proper CORS and cross-subdomain cookie authentication.
9.  **Reliable Article Creation**: Bulletproof dashboard article creation, surfacing server errors in UI, and a 2-step Cloudinary image upload process.

The application utilizes a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, persistently backed by a PostgreSQL database.



**Key Files and Changes:**
*   : Core FastAPI logic.  includes .  handles cross-subdomain.  accepts header/cookie.  for JSON article creation now has comprehensive error handling, robust category coercion, timezone-aware pinning, and critical code duplication removed.  orders by , , , .  endpoint added. Debug endpoints , , , , ,  added. The  route for crawlers was refined for HTML meta tags and fallback logic.
*   :  model includes , , , .  updated with .
*   : New migration to add  column. All migrations (, , ) were made idempotent.
*   : Contains  and . Also  function.
*   : New file created for Render Static Site rewrites, proxying , ,  to the backend API.
*   : New centralized  (Axios) configured with , , and global request/response interceptors for error handling and URL normalization.
*   : Integrated . Main application wrapped in ,  from .
*   :  modified for a 2-step article creation:  (Cloudinary) then . UI elements for , , and  implemented. Enhanced error handling displays structured server messages. Category value converted to lowercase before sending.
*   : Redesigned to use the  component for dynamic news display.
*   : New component fetching  and rendering lead, secondary, and more articles in a responsive, GB News-style layout, with placeholder images for missing ones.
*   : Refactored to use  and fetch article by  from . Implemented robust loading, 404 (article not found), and error states.
*    (e.g., SimpleLogin, ContactSection, MusicSection, NewsSection, DocumentariesSection, ComedySection): All hardcoded  and  calls were replaced with the centralized  instance, and all article links strictly use .

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend (Render Static Site)**: Ensure the  file is correctly deployed and applied by Render for SEO/social sharing rewrites.
-   **Backend**: Refine the  function to fix  crashes, ensure absolute URLs for images, add robust error handling for crawlers (always return 200 HTML), and add HTTP headers for bots.
-   **Backend**: Implement temporary debug endpoints: 
-   **Frontend**: Confirm all article links strictly use  and remove any lingering fallbacks.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two critical production issues: ghost/broken article links for social sharing and Facebook/Twitter previews not showing the headline/image. This involved a systematic review and fix of both frontend and backend components, focusing on correct slug usage, backend HTML rendering for crawlers, and deployment configurations.

**Key activities and findings:**
*   **Frontend Link Audit**: Verified that most article links already use . A  fallback in  was identified and removed to prevent ghost links.
*   **ArticleDetail Component Fix**:  was significantly refactored to use the centralized , correctly fetch articles from , and include robust loading, 404, and error states.
*   **Dashboard Error Handling**: Enhanced to provide more detailed feedback from backend errors.
*   **Backend Debug Endpoint**:  was confirmed to exist.
*   **Category Validation Loop**: A recurring issue where backend Pydantic validation for  was too strict (expecting enum, not case-insensitive string) was finally addressed by converting the category to lowercase in the frontend () before submission.
*   **Centralized API Client Refinement**: The  in  was updated to ensure the  was  and all calls correctly included the  prefix, resolving double-slash issues.
*   **Database Persistence Confirmation**: Despite previous confusion due to local testing environment setup, it was definitively confirmed that articles are being created and persisted correctly in the database, and the  endpoint is populated with new articles (including Cloudinary images). The issue was confirmed to be a database connection discrepancy in testing tools rather than the FastAPI application itself.
*   **SEO Rewrites**: A  file was created in  for Render Static Site rewrites, intended to proxy , , and  to the backend API. It was noted that this specific rewrite functionality couldn't be fully tested in the local simulation but is critical for production.

At the very end of the trajectory, the AI engineer was starting to verify the  file configuration and prepare to implement the backend fixes for the  function to ensure correct meta tags for crawlers.
