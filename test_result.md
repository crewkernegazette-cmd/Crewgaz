# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "🚨 CRITICAL PRODUCTION ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Backend API completely down on https://CrewkerneGazette.co.uk. All API endpoints returning HTTP 500 Internal Server Error including: /api/auth/login (login endpoint), /api/settings/public (public settings), /api/articles (article endpoints). Frontend loads correctly but cannot communicate with backend. CORS headers are properly configured. This is a backend server/deployment issue, not a frontend or authentication problem. The 'login failed' error reported by user is caused by backend API being completely non-functional. URGENT: Backend deployment needs immediate investigation and fix."

      message: "🚨 PRODUCTION BACKEND FAILURE CONFIRMED: Comprehensive testing on actual production domain https://CrewkerneGazette.co.uk reveals complete backend API failure. TEST RESULTS: ✅ Domain accessible (HTTP 200), ✅ Frontend loads correctly, ❌ ALL API endpoints return HTTP 500 'Internal Server Error' (login, settings, articles), ❌ Both admin and admin_backup credentials fail due to server errors, ❌ No backend functionality available. TECHNICAL DETAILS: Server headers show nginx/1.22.1, responses are plain text 'Internal Server Error', CORS configured but irrelevant due to server failure. ROOT CAUSE: Backend deployment/configuration issue - server cannot process any API requests. URGENT ACTION REQUIRED: Check backend server logs, database connectivity, and deployment configuration to restore API functionality."

      message: "🔧 DEPLOYMENT FIX APPLIED: Applied latest backend fixes for production deployment issues. Updated frontend .env to correct production URL (https://CrewkerneGazette.co.uk/api), ensured database name is set to 'test_database' for compatibility, force admin user creation on startup. Restarted all services. Ready for production backend testing to verify login functionality."

      message: "🚨 CRITICAL PRODUCTION UPDATE: Post-deployment fix testing reveals DEPLOYMENT FIXES WORK LOCALLY BUT PRODUCTION STILL BROKEN. LOCAL TESTING: ✅ 100% success rate (6/6 tests passed) - admin login (admin/admin123), public settings, articles, authenticated settings, password change all working perfectly with deployment fixes. PRODUCTION TESTING: ❌ Still complete failure (1/5 tests passed, 20% success rate) - ALL API endpoints continue returning HTTP 500 'Internal Server Error'. DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS: ✅ Frontend loads correctly, ✅ CORS configured, ✅ HTTP methods work, ❌ FastAPI/Uvicorn not detected in production headers, ❌ All API calls fail with 500 errors. CONCLUSION: The deployment fixes are correct and working locally, but production server is NOT running the updated code. Production deployment needs to be updated with the fixed backend code. User login issue persists due to production backend being completely non-functional."
